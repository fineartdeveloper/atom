## `modules` folder README

This folder contains modules that are bundled with the ide-powershell package.
All subfolders are not included in our GitHub repository, they are downloaded
here when the package is loaded in Atom for the first time.

This file serves as a placeholder so that the `modules` folder will be included
in our Git repository.
