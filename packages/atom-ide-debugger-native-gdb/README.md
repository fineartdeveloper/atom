# atom-ide-debugger-native-gdb

C/C++ Native Debugger for Atom IDE.

## Usage

Run `apm install atom-ide-debugger-native-gdb` to install the Atom package.

This repository holds the published Atom package, which is a thin wrapper over the [`atom-ide-debugger-native-gdb` NPM module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/atom-ide-debugger-native-gdb).

The code for `atom-ide-debugger-native-gdb` can be found at https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/tree/master/modules/atom-ide-debugger-native-gdb.

> NOTE: Unfortunately `apm publish` behaves quite differently from NPM, which makes it difficult to maintain both an APM-friendly repository and an NPM-friendly repository. This is our workaround!
