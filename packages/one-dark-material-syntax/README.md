# One Dark Syntax theme (Material)
A fork of atom's 'One Dark' syntax theme, which uses a material colour pallet.  Designed to go with the [Atom Material UI](https://atom.io/themes/atom-material-ui) theme.

## Why?
Atom's 'One Dark' syntax theme has lots of great features that make it stand out from other syntax themes:
- Plenty of keyword highlighting (`require()`, `new Class()`, `var x = y`)
- Object property references highlighting (`object.prop`) (whole expression)
- Operator highlighting (`=`, `===`, `!=`, `?`, `+ - * /`)
- The standard material theme ([atom-material-syntax](https://atom.io/themes/atom-material-syntax)) does not have all these features, so this syntax theme helps add all the features that are mentioned above
