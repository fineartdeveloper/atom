I really liked the [theme](https://ide.atom.io/) that is used for the screencasts on the atom ide promotional page. I hear that the developer that did the screencasts is out of office for some months and that the theme he/she was using was a custom theme that hasn't been released. So I made it! I based this off of [Atom One Dark Syntax](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax).

I haven't tested this for many languages, so if you see any odd syntax highlighting for a language, please submit an issue.
